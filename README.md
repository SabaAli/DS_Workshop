# Data Data Science & Machine Learning Tutorial
Welcome to DCFemTech's Tour de Code Data Science & Machine Learning Tutorial hosted by Booz Allen Hamilton's Women in Data Science.


## Agenda
1. Welcome
1. Introductions
1. Setting up the Environment
1. Notebook Tutorial

## Downloading the Repository
Download the DS_Workshop repository/folder to your Desktop by clicking on the green "Clone or download" button and then clicking "Download ZIP"

If you have experience using Git, you can clone the repository via command line by typing:

```
git clone https://github.com/SabaAli/DS_Workshop.git
```

## Technical Requirements
- Download and install **[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)** with Python 3.6

Anaconda is a free package manager, environment manager, and Python distribution that contains a collection of 1,000+ open source packages. An installation of Anaconda comes preinstalled with many of the Python packages we'll be using such as numpy, matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn, and seaborn and is the recommended way to install Jupyter Notebooks.

After installing Anaconda, you can open Anaconda Navigator and click on Jupyter Notebook, which will launch in your browser. Then you can navigate to the DS_Workshop folder you downloaded. You can also launch Jupyter Notebook by typing ```jupyter notebook``` in your command line.

Installing the Jupyter Notebook will also install the IPython kernel. This allows working on notebooks using the Python programming language.


## Datasets
This tutorial uses the Census Income dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Respository. This dataset has been already been added to the ```datasets``` folder.
